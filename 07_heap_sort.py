"""
Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a Binary Heap data structure. It is
similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element
at the end. We repeat the same process for the remaining element.

Time complexity: O(n log n).
Space complexity of O(n).
